# hello-world
Just another repository

Hello there, my name is Nick Spera.
Currently I am teaching myself, via Flatiron's FullStack software development bootcamp, to code!
My fiancee and I are getting married next month and have plans to move to Europe in the spring.
She can work remotely, and is in the software development industry and can work remotely.
Learning code is a way for me to transition to a 'digital nomad' lifestyle so I will be able to work remotely too!
After I have completed this bootcamp I will apply to the Learn at Your Own Pace, Full Stack Engineering Program
  at FlarIron :)
Wish me luck!
